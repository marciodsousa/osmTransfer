What is this?
Just a very simple extension for chrome that I did to learn something about the 
subject.

What it does?
Creates a button on the left of the chrome tabs, and when clicked a javascript 
file(that@marciodsousa wrote) runs and adds information to the transfer list.

How to use it?
a) Installation:
    1.Open chrome
    2.Enter chrome://extensions/
    3.Check "Developer Mode"
    4.Select "Load unpacked extension..."
    5.Select this file root folder

b) Use it:
    1.Go to http: //en.onlinesoccermanager.com/League/TransferList
    2.Click on the "Hack my transfer list!" button
    3.Wait for it
    4.Wait a bit more
